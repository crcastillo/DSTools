# DStools

### Project Objective
Build my first R package containing an ever-expanding list of functions that I typically use in predictive model 
building, hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations. 

### Required Libraries
* pwr
* ggplot2
* dplyr

## Functions
1. fx_Align_Impute (Released): Generate a new data.frame that aligns a target data.frame's classes/levels from a 
reference data.frame 
2. fx_allClass (Released): Return the classes of the columns from a reference data.frame 
3. fx_PropTest_1p (Released): Generate a list of objects from a 1 sample-1 proportion test that includes key alpha and
beta levels from a provided set of constraints and sample observation counts
4. fx_mode (Released): Return the most frequently occurring element within a given vector
5. fx_homogenize (Planned): Return two groups that are as similar to each other based on a provided set of matching
elements
